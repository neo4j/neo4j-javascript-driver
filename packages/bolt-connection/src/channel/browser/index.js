This module exports a set of components to be used in browser environment.
They are not compatible with NodeJS environment.
All files import/require APIs from `node/index.js` by default.
Such imports are replaced at build time with `browser/index.js` when building a browser bundle.

NOTE: exports in this module should have exactly the same names/structure as exports in `node/index.js`.
