This module exports a set of components to be used in NodeJS environment.
They are not compatible with browser environment.
All files that require environment-dependent APIs should import this file by default.
Imports/requires are replaced at build time with `browser/index.js` when building a browser bundle.

NOTE: exports in this module should have exactly the same names/structure as exports in `browser/index.js`.
