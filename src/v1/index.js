/**
 * Construct a new Neo4j Driver. This is your main entry point for this
 * library.
 *
 * ## Configuration
 *
 * This function optionally takes a configuration argument. Available configuration
 * options are as follows:
 *
 *     {
 *       // Encryption level: ENCRYPTION_ON or ENCRYPTION_OFF.
 *       encrypted: ENCRYPTION_ON|ENCRYPTION_OFF
 *
 *       // Trust strategy to use if encryption is enabled. There is no mode to disable
 *       // trust other than disabling encryption altogether. The reason for
 *       // this is that if you don't know who you are talking to, it is easy for an
 *       // attacker to hijack your encrypted connection, rendering encryption pointless.
 *       //
 *       // TRUST_ALL_CERTIFICATES is the default choice for NodeJS deployments. It only requires
 *       // new host to provide a certificate and does no verification of the provided certificate.
 *       //
 *       // TRUST_ON_FIRST_USE is available for modern NodeJS deployments, and works
 *       // similarly to how `ssl` works - the first time we connect to a new host,
 *       // we remember the certificate they use. If the certificate ever changes, we
 *       // assume it is an attempt to hijack the connection and require manual intervention.
 *       // This means that by default, connections "just work" while still giving you
 *       // good encrypted protection.
 *       //
 *       // TRUST_CUSTOM_CA_SIGNED_CERTIFICATES is the classic approach to trust verification -
 *       // whenever we establish an encrypted connection, we ensure the host is using
 *       // an encryption certificate that is in, or is signed by, a certificate listed
 *       // as trusted. In the web bundle, this list of trusted certificates is maintained
 *       // by the web browser. In NodeJS, you configure the list with the next config option.
 *       //
 *       // TRUST_SYSTEM_CA_SIGNED_CERTIFICATES means that you trust whatever certificates
 *       // are in the default certificate chain of th
 *       trust: "TRUST_ALL_CERTIFICATES" | "TRUST_ON_FIRST_USE" | "TRUST_SIGNED_CERTIFICATES" |
 *       "TRUST_CUSTOM_CA_SIGNED_CERTIFICATES" | "TRUST_SYSTEM_CA_SIGNED_CERTIFICATES",
 *
 *       // List of one or more paths to trusted encryption certificates. This only
 *       // works in the NodeJS bundle, and only matters if you use "TRUST_CUSTOM_CA_SIGNED_CERTIFICATES".
 *       // The certificate files should be in regular X.509 PEM format.
 *       // For instance, ['./trusted.pem']
 *       trustedCertificates: [],
 *
 *       // Path to a file where the driver saves hosts it has seen in the past, this is
 *       // very similar to the ssl tool's known_hosts file. Each time we connect to a
 *       // new host, a hash of their certificate is stored along with the domain name and
 *       // port, and this is then used to verify the host certificate does not change.
 *       // This setting has no effect unless TRUST_ON_FIRST_USE is enabled.
 *       knownHosts:"~/.neo4j/known_hosts",
 *
 *       // The max number of connections that are allowed idle in the pool at any time.
 *       // Connection will be destroyed if this threshold is exceeded.
 *       // **Deprecated:** please use `maxConnectionPoolSize` instead.
 *       connectionPoolSize: 100,
 *

 *       // so that new session is never backed by an old connection. Setting this option to a low value will cause
 *       // a high connection churn and might result in a performance hit. It is recommended to set maximum lifetime
 *       // to a slightly smaller value than the one configured in network equipment (load balancer, proxy, firewall,
 *       // etc. can also limit maximum connection lifetime). No maximum lifetime limit is imposed by default. Zero
 *       // and negative values result in lifetime not being checked.

 *       // initially imported using neo4j import tool and contained numbers larger than
 *       // `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`. Driver will then return positive infinity, which is lossy.

 *       // in loss of precision in the general case.
 *       disableLosslessIntegers: false,

 *       // its default value is 'info'. Levels have priorities: 'error': 0, 'warn': 1, 'info': 2, 'debug': 3. Enabling a certain level also enables all
 *       // levels with lower priority. For example: 'error', 'warn' and 'info' will be logged when 'info' level is configured.
 *       //
 *       // Property `logger` represents the logging function which will be invoked for every log call with an acceptable level. The function should
 *       // take two string arguments `level` and `message`. The function should not execute any blocking or long-running operations
 *       // because it is often executed on a hot path.
